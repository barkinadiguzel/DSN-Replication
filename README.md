# DSN-Replication
DSN-Replication: A PyTorch implementation of Deeply-Supervised Nets (DSN), where hidden layers receive companion supervision to improve feature discriminativeness and accelerate convergence. This framework includes modular convolutional blocks, companion classifiers, and combined loss computation for theoretical experimentation.
